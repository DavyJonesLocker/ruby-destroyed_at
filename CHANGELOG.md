## 2.1.1
* Fixes an error when deleting parent with dependent destroy when child uses 
destroyed_at. Thanks [minimul](https://github.com/minimul) for [pull
#68](https://github.com/DockYard/ruby-destroyed_at/pull/68).

## 2.1.0
* Allows `#mark_for_destruction` to be passed a timestamp which will be
  used for future calls to `destroy`. Thanks
  [anarchocurious](https://github.com/anarchocurious)!
* Fixes polymorphic associations for dependencies that don't have the
  same `destroyed_at` timestamp. Thanks
  [nashby](https://github.com/nashby)!

## 2.0.0
* Associated models that do not include `DestroyedAt` will now be
  **deleted** via `dependent: :destroy`. Previously, this was only the
behavior for child records; however, child records can now delete the
parent record (in accordance with default ActiveRecord behavior).

## 1.0.2
* Fixes an issue in which
  `DestroyedAt::BelongsToAssociation#handle_dependency` was not deriving
the action from the `options` hash, but was using `method` and raising
an error for the wrong number of arguments. Thanks to
[harmdewit](https://github.com/harmdewit) for catching this!

## 1.0.1
* Fixes an issue where the incorrect arguments were being passed
  from inside the `BelongsToAssociation` and `HasOneAssociation`, as
reported by [anarchocurious](https://github.com/anarchocurious)

## 1.0.0

* Requires equal to or greater than Ruby `2.0` -
  [ryanwood](https://github.com/ryanwood)
* Updates `reflections` to `_reflections` -
  [mukimov](https://github.com/mukimov)
* Fixes an exception which was was raised when attempting to destroy a 
target record whose parent did not mix in DestroyedAt.

## 0.4.0

* Updates for Rails 4.1
* Removes `.with_default_scope` which has been deprecated.
* Enables retrieval of destroyed objects by time via `.destroyed`
  method, which now takes an optional time attribute. - [linstula](https://github.com/linstula) & [danmcclain](https://github.com/danmcclain)
* Removes `m` as a development dependency, since it is not compatible
  with `minitest 5`.
