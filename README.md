## Looking for help? ##

If it is a bug [please open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/dockyard/destroyed_at/issues).

## Installation ##

Add the `destroyed_at` gem to your `Gemfile`

```ruby
gem 'destroyed_at'
```

You can either mixin the modules on a case-by-case basis:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  include DestroyedAt
end
```

or make the changes globally:

```ruby
class ActiveRecord::Base
  include DestroyedAt
end
```

**Please note you will need to make a migration**

Each model's table that is expected to have this behavior **must** have
a `destroyed_at` column of type `DateTime`.

It is recommended that you add an index on the model's `destroyed_at` column,
so that your database does not have to do a table scan for every query.
Only Postgres' query indexes will be of any benefit:

```db
CREATE INDEX ON users WHERE destroyed_at IS NULL;
CREATE INDEX ON users WHERE destroyed_at IS NOT NULL;
```

## Usage ##
Allows you to "destroy" an object without deleting the record or
associated records.

### Destroying ###
Overides `#destroy` to set `#destroyed_at` to the current time on an object. The
default scope of the class is then set to return objects that have not
been destroyed (i.e., have `nil` for their destroyed_at value).

`#destroyed?` will be `true` when your model is destroyed; it will be
`false` when your model has been restored.

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  include DestroyedAt
end

user = User.create
user.destroy 
# => true
user.destroyed_at
# => <DateTime>
```

#### Warning: Dependent relations with destroy ####
Be careful when destroying parent relationships that have `dependent:
:destroy`. If the child
relationship does not also `include DestroyedAt`, then when you call
`#destroy` on the parent instance, you will delete the child record,
rather than simply marking it `destroyed_at`.

The same goes for destroying through relations that omit `include
DestroyedAt`, even if the parent and child models include the mixin.

### Restoring ####
When you'd like to "restore" a record, call the `#restore` method on
the instance. This will set its `#destroyed_at` value to `nil`, thereby
including it in the default scope of the class again.

To include this functionality on `has_many through` relationships,
be sure to `include DestroyedAt` on the through model, as well as the
parent model.

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  include DestroyedAt
end

user = User.create
user.destroy
user.restore
# => true
user.destroyed_at
# => nil
```

### Destroyed Scope ###
When you include the `DestroyedAt` module, it sets a default scope of 
`where(destroyed_at: nil)`. It also defines a scope called `.destroyed`
which removes the default scope and finds the records of a relation
`where.not(destroyed_at: nil)`. This is different than calling `unscoped`
on the class/relation. Where unscoped will remove all scoping from a
relation, `.destroyed` only removes the default scope generated by the
`DestroyedAt` module, making it safe to call on relations.

### Callbacks ###
`before_restore`, `after_restore` and `around_restore` callbacks are added to your
model. They work similarly to the `before_destroy`, `after_destroy` and `around_restore`
callbacks.

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  before_restore :before_restore_action
  after_restore  :after_restore_action
  around_restore :around_restore_action
  
  private
  
  def before_restore_action
    ...
  end
  
  def after_restore_action
    ...
  end

  def around_restore_action
    # before around
    yield # restoring...
    # after around
end
```

### Validations ###

If you are using the `uniqueness` validator you will need to run it as:

```ruby
validates :email, uniqueness: { conditions: -> { where(destroyed_at: nil) } }
```

Rails will by default not include default_scopes when querying for uniqueness. Rather than monkey 
patching the validator we believe this is the best solution.
